# ðŸ§¬ Pokedex â€“ C Programming Project

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This project implements a **Pokedex** system in **C**, designed to retrieve and manage information about PokÃ©mon and their types. The focus is on practicing memory management using **structs**, **pointers**, **dynamic allocation**, and **modular design**.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- Written in **C**
- Handles multiple PokÃ©mon and types from a config file
- Emphasizes proper memory usage and modularity
- Composed of multiple source/header files

---

## ðŸ—‚ File Structure

- `Pokemon.h` â€“ Struct definitions and function declarations for PokÃ©mon
- `Pokemon.c` â€“ Implements PokÃ©mon-related logic
- `Pokedex.c` â€“ Main program and interface logic
- `Defs.h` â€“ Shared definitions and constants

---

## âœ… Key Requirements

- Proper dynamic memory allocation and deallocation  
- No memory leaks â€“ validate with Valgrind  
- Clear modular separation of logic  
- Adherence to output format for automated tests  


---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

- Deepen understanding of C memory management  
- Practice modular programming  
- Apply clean code principles and documentation standards
